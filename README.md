Codes for triadic percolation on Poisson networks, scale-free networks and real networks written by Hanlin Sun (<sunhanlin15@gmail.com>) and Ginestra Bianconi (<ginestra.bianconi@gmail.com>).

This repository contains Julia and C codes that have been optimized for the algorithm on large network models and datasets. We also provide MATLAB and Python codes that can be used alternatively for testing the algorithms on smaller (up to thousend nodes) networks.

 Julia codes: 

- `functions.jl`: The codes include all the functions used for producing orbit diagrams from both theory and Monte Carlo simulation.
- `poi_simulation_theory.ipynb`: Examples of triadic percolation on Poisson structural networks with both theoretical and simulation results.
- `sf_simulation_theory.ipynb`: Examples of triadic percolation on scale-free structural networks with both theoretical and simulation results.
- `real_data_simulation.ipynb`: Examples of triadic percolation on real structural networks with simulation results.

C codes:
- `configuration.c`: Generate structural networks with scale-free/Poisson degree distribution and regulatory network with Poisson degree distribution.
- `GC_triadic_from_edgelist.c`: Simulation of triadic percolation with networks generated by `configuration.c`.
- `GC_triadic_from_data.c`: Simulation of triadic percolation with real structural network (`bio_edgelist_clean.txt` or `bn_mouse_clean.txt`) and regulatory network with Poisson degree distribution.

MATLAB codes:
- `poisson_simulation_theory.m`: Examples of triadic percolation on Poisson structural networks with both theoretical and simulation results, implemented in MATLAB. The dynamic can be illustrated as a movie.

Python codes:
- `poisson_simulation_theory.m`: Examples of triadic percolation on Poisson structural networks with both theoretical and simulation results. implemented in Python.

Datasets:
- `bio_edgelist_clean.txt`: Human bio grid network. Self links and multilinks are removed. The network is considered undirected in the simulation.
- `bn_mouse_clean.txt`: Mouse brain network. Self links and multilinks are removed. The network is considered undirected in the simulation.


# How to use
The Julia codes are implemented in Julia 1.8. Packages used are `LinearAlgebra`, `SpecialFunctions` and `Random`.

The Python codes requires packages `NetworkX`, `NumPy`, `SciPy`.
